# To_do


so the easy  plan for now is the left side will be the list of all probjets and they would be stroed ina array? maybe an array of lasses overall just stroed in a list somewehre and have the title assiated to it, each of it iwll be a button and if clicked it will refredsh and load the right side of the page with all the task.
the task will be a class that has a title, discrpiton, and date and the interesting part in my opiton will be the chedck mark part but I think i will go bac and see what I did for the one repo i made forgo trwhat it was but really similar,
it will have a priooty part that each project ill havee three different list, one teir one , tier two, teir three, and when loading the pages it will start from the tier one to tier tree, after adding a file to the list it will refresh and place it in the rfight place if possible make a chedckiing fucniton that will ensure no dates in the past of current date but idk yet.
